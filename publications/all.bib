      abstract={
        Model-based reinforcement learning approaches add explicit domain
        knowledge to agents in hopes of improving the
        sample-efficiency in comparison to model-free
        agents. However, in practice model-based methods are
        unable to achieve the same asymptotic performance on
        challenging continuous control tasks due to the
        complexity of learning and controlling an explicit
        world model. In this paper we investigate the
        stochastic value gradient (SVG), which is a
        well-known family of methods for controlling
        continuous systems which includes model-based
        approaches that distill a model-based value
        expansion into a model-free policy. We consider a
        variant of the model-based SVG that scales to larger
        systems and uses 1) an entropy regularization to
        help with exploration, 2) a learned deterministic
        world model to improve the short-horizon value
        estimate, and 3) a learned model-free value estimate
        after the model's rollout. This SVG variation
        captures the model-free soft actor-critic method as
        an instance when the model rollout horizon is zero,
        and otherwise uses short-horizon model rollouts to
        improve the value estimate for the policy update. We
        surpass the asymptotic performance of other
        model-based methods on the proprioceptive MuJoCo
        locomotion tasks from the OpenAI gym, including a
        humanoid. We notably achieve these results with a
        simple deterministic world model without requiring
        an ensemble.

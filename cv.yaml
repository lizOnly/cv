about: '
  I am a research scientist at <b>Facebook AI (FAIR)</b> in NYC and
  study foundational topics in <b>machine learning</b> and <b>optimization</b>,
  recently involving reinforcement learning, control,
  optimal transport, and geometry.
  I am interested in building learning systems that understand and
  interact with our world.
  I freely publish my research code to \href{https://github.com/bamos}{GitHub}
  as science should be open and reproducible and
  well-crafted software enables new frontiers.
